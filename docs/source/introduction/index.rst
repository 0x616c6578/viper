Concept
=======

The main idea behind this project is to build a framework to store, classify and investigate binary files of any sort.
In order to analyze binaries of different nature (being a PE32, a PDF document or an Office document) we have a large number of very diversified and scattered scripts and tools available on the Internet and developed by numerous parties.
Having a unique framework would both ease the creation of such scripts as well as facilitate their collection and provide a one-stop place for researchers to refer to.
This is still a very primitive idea.
